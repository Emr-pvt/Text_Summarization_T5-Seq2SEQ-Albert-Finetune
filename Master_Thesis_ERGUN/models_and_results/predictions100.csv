"can casters and production teams atleast be allowed to spam all their dank memes during these tournaments to keep up the fun? I mean if everyone craves professionalism then they can do that for the rest of the year but I think it's ridiculous for tournament like the Summit, XMG 3.0, etc. Can players and crews at least spam their funny meme posts during the tournament",Watching studio hosted tournaments without all the memes is like watching an R-Rated movie without the adult content. n Edit: For everyone that will say that XMG 3.0 has had a lot of memes already there actually hasn't.

if I'm gay I can't possibly understand the shame attached to being gay. n So donâ€™t you dare say in one breath that you're not homophobic but in the next say that having some guy suck your dick would make you feel ashamed. This is the whole reason why coming out is a big deal for gay people. It's the,"If a girl sucked my dick, it wouldn't be fun for me, in the same way that fucking an apple pie wouldn't be fun.
