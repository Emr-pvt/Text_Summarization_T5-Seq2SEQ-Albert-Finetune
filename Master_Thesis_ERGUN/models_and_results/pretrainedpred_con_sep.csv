math is very useful in solving problems. n that's pretty simple, but it works really for the simple stuff. it can describe how much pressure is in an oven as it heats up, or being able to determine the change in frequency of light from a distant star. that leap is pretty significant when you think about it.;Physicists started using math as play blocks, and built some pretty sweet castles that can describe the universe.
big companies prefer the used-game-blocking system, the premium titles only come out for that system. the developers don't make any additional money if everyone has to buy their own brand new copy sales would explode and companies knowing that would exclusivly produce for this system.;good for companies but extremly bad for gamers with limited budget \nedit: source: [Total Biscuit](
we had a regular wooden swing set, also not set into the ground, so it would do the same. as we grew older and swung ourselves, we also had to extend the chains on the swings so we could get on.;make sure you have open space behind and in front if swing sets.
the inadequacy of mental health services is being highlighted, and the extreme strain that many of these people and their families are under. the mother is simply sharing her experience and comparing her son to Lanza, but neither mental illnesses themselves nor individuals with them are interchangeable, he says. n the risk this creates, for me, is that people tend to take these initially fairly innocuous comparisons and run with him once they're;I entirely agree with the mother that mental health services, and the lack thereof, are a subject we seriously need to discuss. However, the creation of a mass murderer is rarely as simple as any one pathology, and I would be wary of honest but clumsy attempts at armchair psychiatry spreading common misconceptions about mental health in general.

I ratted him out to his supervisor when I left, and said this apparently happens a lot.;Be nice to people who work at Sonic or they'll spit in your drinks. \n edit:  I mean it happens a lot as in a lot of managers/employees at multiple Sonic locations have been fired for spitting in drinks.  That's what our area supervisor told me anyway.
we've been together for 3 years, and it's been mostly great. I confronted her about this yesterday, but I still feel like there' is something missing. n this is because yesterday we met a girl, we kind of hit it off. and I find myself missing the new-ness and exciting part at the beginning.;Relationship not what it used to be, met someone new, makes me feel like I'm done.
daaaammmnn has a hard time recommending the movie to others without lots of warnings. it's an amazing piece of cinema and stands out within the art form.;the scene is bad but you must watch it in full context of the whole movie to understand it's relevance.
'everyone should learn how to play against it' n fk that, this is ranked, learn on your own time. you are assuming FAR too much about the enemy and the rest of your team.

your goal is to get to level 6 without being pushed out of lane. if enemy lux hits you with an auto only, she will take more from 3 caster minions than she dealt to you. three starting options are doran shield 1 potion, boots 4 potio, 2 beads 3 potione - but it makes you nearly impossible to push out alane, as you have effectively 930 bonus total hp regained by your;build void staff second every single game UNLESS not a single member of their team is building any MR or any items that build into MR then you get hourglass bc its active is op). Basically you want enough damage to kill who you need to and then build defenses enough to survive the damage you will inevitably take. I find the item set I feel best on is sorcs, dfg/dcap, void, hourglass, abyssal, ga/banshee/warmog (banshee and warmog when ga is on cd, remember stays 5min cd even while 'in store' so keep your own timer) \n for what skill to max, Q or W, both are viable. I very very often max W, because you get much more out of your point than maxing Q. You cannot always proc Q, but if you are using W, you are using W, you don't miss anything out. It increases damage, but also movespeed bonus, and the spell has a lower cooldown, so it is more possible damage output, as well as more possible waveclear. Katarina is very strong at roams but you cannot roam if you cannot waveclear. Maxing Q is good against lanes that you cannot ever trade with in melee range where if you can W you will die, for example, pantheon mid will always win trades, if you EW he just jumps back on you for his combo. So you max Q and just poke farm poke farm and wait for your roam opportunity or drag fight.

this movie is fucking hilarious and overwrought and generally pretty great. so we are watching it while kind of fooling around and whatever and one particularly stupid, over dramatic line is read by Nicole Kidman and I just lose my shit and start laughing my ass off. n Getting up and immediately falling into a sweaty fetal position ball of severe head pain, vomiting profusely for an hour straight and ending up in emergency neurosur;I laughed at a bad line in a movie and popped a blood vessell in my brain.

I've been in a routine of doing 300 pushups. I usually alternate with sets of 50 and 40 and finish up with 30.

n so I made the mistake of brining up my past relationships with my girlfriend last night on the telephone. she told her that I went through 3 unsuccessful relationships - and she thinks that she'll be one of those girls reminiscing over them to her over the phone. we haven't had a phone call for one week before this because she travels with her religious conservative parents, so there was no privacy to phone me.;I brought up my past relationships with my girlfriend and she's worried and upset. \n UPDATE:  Everything is all good now.

my apartment is pretty small, so I opted for the Japanese style bed which gave me space to walk around during the day. my girlfriend kept pushing for me to get a Western bed, but I told her several times that it was too big and would be more of an burden than anything. n today I get an amazing delivery of 'a massive bed frame, boxspring, and side table';"Girlfriend bought me something she knew I didn\'t want, can\'t return it without steep expense. \n Edit1 : She came over and I spoke to her about it and she asked why I thought she got me the bed. I told her because she thought it would be more comfortable for her than my futon and she started to cry. She said it was because I\'m starting a new job as a professor and she thought I would need to sleep comfortably. I hugged her, we built the bed, had sex, and now she\'s taking a nap in the new bed. She\'s never taken a nap at my place before. My apartment is literally a bed and a desk now. \n Edit 2 : Just for clarification, a Japanese futon is much different from what we call a futon in the west. I can\'t link any pictures here, but just Google ""Japanese futon"" to see what they look like. And for more context: she is Japanese, I am American, we\'ve been dating for a year, she has a Western style bed at home, and I slept in it last night and it was comfortable, though it has still eaten up my free space."

n the problem is that speech is money, and a small number of people have most of the money. the current system puts the rich up on the stage with officials, gives them fliers on everybody's car, while those few people who care to speak up for everybody or anybody else have to try and talk over the megaphone.;speech is (or at least requires) money.

the whole point of this iteration of Captains Draft and tournaments like the Summit is to be a fun tournament that the players and viewers are supposed to enjoy. can casters and production teams atleast be allowed to spam all their dank memes to keep up the fun? I think it's ridiculous for tournament s such as the summit, XMG 3.0 etc.;Watching studio hosted tournaments without all the memes is like watching an R-Rated movie without the adult content. \n Edit: For everyone that will say that XMG 3.0 has had a lot of memes already there actually hasn't. SUNSFan and Synderen referenced how everyone had to turn down the memes for this tournament. \n Edit 2: This will probably get downvoted and die in new but I still wanted to make this rant. Thanks for reading!

reddit is complex to use because it's complex. it doesn't use it because its complex and complex. a lot of people know about it but people around me know what it is but they know if it comes up they don’t have it - it makes it difficult to rely on it so it can be very expensive and expensive but it has the most expensive price and is not expensive.;reddits commonly known but hard to use so they don't
after a local punk band rock show in the inner city, my brother and I began to walk home. he had recently moved closer to the area, but it was maybe 2 mile walk, so it wasn''t right, we turn around and eventually get back to original street and go to other end, from which we originally entered it.;Walking home from a party with my brother.

my friend received his legendary raid sparrow a couple weeks back. this happened while on the way to the Daily heroic. n (you don't see how it happened but you can hear the explosions in the background when it did happen);After blasting me off my sparrow with his legendary Raid sparrow, he tried it again only to glitch himself into the cab of a truck...
the next day the principal announced no more live animals would be allowed at our carnivals any longer. the school carnival has a booth and someone said they would give us tickets for swallowing the goldfish they won from the biology students' booth.;My first sushi experience in high school = no more animals at carnival.
"when I was three my parents went to a Baptist Church to be the Godparents for their friend's kid. they came back to find me giving some nonsensical sermon, done in mock preacher voice with movements that mimicked the preachers inside the church.

reverse proxy type DDOS defense system works by monitoring inconsistencies in HTTP/HTTPS transactions to identify an attack. most online games use UDP ports to achieve low latency, and don't mesh well with reverse proxies. there are other options line 3rd party scrubbers (send traffic somewhere else to be sanitiZed), and ISP border blacklisting (if anyone from THESE IPs reaches;gaming doesn't play well with conventional DDOS defenses.
n Mutant abilities are simply a tool. it is an extreme violation of human rights to assume guilty intent without illegal or harmful action. magneto, or any other mutants who have displayed violent, harmful actions, should be disciplined just as you would anyone other human who committed such acts, upon others.;everyone has the ability to do good or evil. A reasonable society reacts instead to the actions.
if I'm gay, I can't understand shame attached to being gay. n shame is the whole reason why coming out is a big deal for gay people. it's the end of an 'internised homophobia' which is caused by the prejudice of society. homosexuals do away with fear and shame and accept who they are, abandoning their latent homophophobia in the process.;If a girl sucked my dick, it wouldn't be fun for me, in the same way that fucking an apple pie wouldn't be fun. But it sure as fuck wouldn't make me feel ashamed. But then I guess I'm not hanging on to the implicit belief that being straight is wrong. So whatever. \n Edit: post written before your ninja edit in which you deleted the part where you told me that if I'm gay then I should shut the fuck up because I don't know what I'm talking about
"'i feel like I was a terrible boyfriend to my now ex-girlfriend,' she says. she had put me down in several ways since wants to ""start playing house"" she has just started hers, and it hurt, much, but she's not receiving empathy, or genuine compassion that you expect from your partner in the time of need. n she feels as if she neglected her and she let me know it.'";I really don't know where I'm going with this.. She was a wonderful girl, and I feel like I destroyed a great future tonight. I went over to her house and broke it off as I've seen a reoccurring trend of bringing one another down consistently, me withdrawing from her due to statements which were painful, me being a dick in various ways, and I feel I am mostly to blame for just being a ignorant piece of shit. \n I've been sobbing like a child for the past 7 hours, as I know I've been a bad boyfriend and I hurt her so much, but I felt like it needed to end for the good of both of us despite it fucking hurting so much right now.
a ton of shit can go wrong with any shuttle mission, especially during launch and re-entry. in the case of the Columbia breakup, they surmised from the crew's injuries that they were essentially beaten to death by tiny shockwaves caused by various debri encountering the atmosphere and rapidly slowing.;Astronauts are badass mofos willing to put their lives on the line to further mankind's understanding of the universe.

a friend of mine and her ex-bf asked me to meet her downtown in college. she called me and asked her to pick her up in front of school and she didn't want to go anywhere with her anymore but she wanted to make her jealous that she's out having good time. n he said no to her request and while she was off with another guy doing the same thing she bought me 2 shots.;Drunken idiot demands drinks and makes a fool of herself and me.

the hospital doesn't just eat that cost, they pass it on to the insurance companies. if you think they die in the street with no medical attention, you can pay for the healthcare of everyone else covered by the company.;you pay for everybody's healthcare whether you like it or not, whether they get it in a doctor's office or in the ER (where it tends to be more expensive)
n graduated college with a 2.09 gpa in history. I had valeted all through college and couldn't find an job after graduating. he left the restaurant and got in his car and saw his ID tag for work. the company was small and although I was an intern, I managed the entire project life cycle. after three months of studying I got my certificate and began studying for my CAPM.;I got lucky with my first job and then honed my skills in a field I enjoyed to further my career. It takes a lot more work to show your worth when you have a Shitty gpa.

I stopped my childhood friend who I met in kindergarten from driving home tonight. it took a lot of convincing and lying to get him just to stick around for 5 minutes. n Sure enough he ended up puking and passed out very shortly after on the couch.;Reddit don't let your friends drink and drive. Nothing bad in the story above happened and I hope all of you do the same.
