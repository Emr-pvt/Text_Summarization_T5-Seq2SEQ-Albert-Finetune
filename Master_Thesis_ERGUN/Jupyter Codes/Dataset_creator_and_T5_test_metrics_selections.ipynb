Newfoundland 2 summers ago.  We went to the beach with my 3 younger cousins.  We swam, ate a picnic and just had wholesome family fun.  I snuck a ciggy while the family was frolicking in the surf. I had no where to pitch my butt so I buried it.  On the drive home my granddad realizes that his partial denture isn\\'t in his mouth.  I just look at him and say \"I\\'m the finder of things, turn around\"  We drive back to the beach, tide is coming in.
